    "\n",
    "We will be using the expert system example provided in the instructions, of helping students find suitable recipes so they are incentivized to eat inside and lower risk of infection. The expert system will function on the following 8 askables: \"How much time does the student have to make the meal?\", \"How much effort in cooking do you want?\", \"What type of meal do you want? (Appetizer, Main, Dessert)\" \"Do you have any dietary goals? (Pleasure, Weight Loss, Weight Gain, etc...\", \"Which cuisine do you prefer?\", \"Which diet do you prefer?\", \"Ingredients to look for?\", \"How many calories are you aiming for?\". Some of these askables are dependent on each other. For example, if the person has a specific diet, that will influence the available options for asking what their preferred cuisine is because we may not have their diet available in all cusines.\n",

    "4. Then we ask about total time available to prepare the meal, with options between <5m, <15m, <30m, >30m, filtering appropriately. \n",

    "7. Then we ask if the user has any ingredients they would like to use from the remaining recipes that still match the previously selected questions. \n",
